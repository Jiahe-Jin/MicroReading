**Important Notation**

The ***lib*** folder is the place to store all of tested and standard images. Each time users want to add new tests into the program, they just need to copy and paste the images into the ***lib*** folder, and then using <update> and <process> commands to operate images. 

**Next Generation**

In the future, the real user interface can be developed by JavaFX to give out the real GUI Interface for convenient operations on it. And the statistic analysis methods should be more complete to give out more abundant graphs.
