**Introduction**

This application works for the Urine Stone Risk Detector to record, analyze pictures being uploaded, and finally gives out the statistic results for the data read from token photoes.

**Current Status**

Now, I just costrcuted the framework for this application. The images now can be added directly under the MicroReading folder to be analyzed. This framework only works for loading, storing, showing the picture and converting it into greyscale. The next step is to implement the color difference analysis methods and complete it.
